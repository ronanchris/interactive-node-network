## Tools and Scripts

1. **Monitoring**
   ```bash
   npm run monitor        # Start performance monitoring
   npm run check-metrics # View current metrics
   npm run analyze      # Generate performance report
   ```

2. **Optimization**
   ```bash
   npm run optimize    # Run optimization tasks
   npm run benchmark  # Run performance tests
   npm run profile   # Generate performance profile
   ```

## Integration

Our performance system integrates with:
- [Error Handling](../errors/README.md)
- [Session Management](../session-management.md)
- [Machine Configuration](../machine-management.md)

## Best Practices

   - Regular metric collection
   - Proactive alerting
   - Trend analysis
   - Capacity planning

2. **Optimization**
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Systematic improvements
   - User experience focus
   - Resource efficiency

3. **Documentation**
   - Performance baselines
   - Optimization history
   - Known bottlenecks
   - Solution patterns

## Getting Help

1. Check specific performance documentation:
   - [Monitoring](./monitoring.md) for tracking performance
   - [Thresholds](./thresholds.md) for performance limits
   - [Optimization](./optimization.md) for improvements

2. Review the [Learning Journal](../learning/learning-journal.md) for insights

3. Consult the [Glossary](../glossary.md) for terminology

## Contributing

When adding performance documentation:
1. Include metric definitions
2. Document measurement methods
3. Provide optimization steps
4. Update baseline metrics

Remember: Performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and adjustment.

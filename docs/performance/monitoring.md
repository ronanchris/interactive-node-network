# Performance Monitoring

This document outlines the performance monitoring system for the Interactive Node Network project.

## Overview

Performance monitoring is essential for maintaining optimal system performance and user experience. This guide details our monitoring approach, tools, and metrics.

## Monitoring Components

### System Monitoring

- CPU usage
- Memory utilization
- Disk I/O
- Network latency
- System load
- Process health

### Application Monitoring

- Response times
- Error rates
- Transaction throughput
- Cache hit rates
- API performance
- Resource usage

### User Experience Monitoring

- Page load times
- Time to interactive
- First contentful paint
- Interaction delays
- Frame rates
- Animation smoothness

## Monitoring Tools

### Development Tools

- Chrome DevTools
- React DevTools
- Performance profiler
- Memory profiler
- Network analyzer

### Production Tools

- System metrics collector
- Application metrics dashboard
- Error tracking system
- User experience monitor
- Resource utilization tracker

### Custom Metrics

- Error rate thresholds
- Performance degradation alerts
- System health notifications
- User experience impacts

### Alert Channels

- Email notifications
- Slack integration
- Dashboard alerts
- System logs
- Team notifications

## Data Collection

### Metrics Collection

# Dashboard Deployment and Indexing Issues - March 17, 2024

## Session Overview
- **Date**: March 17, 2024
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Machine**: M3-Max
- **Branch**: main
- **Dependencies**: Previous dashboard setup session

## Environment State
- **Node Version**: v23.10.0
- **npm Version**: 10.9.2
- **Git Remote**: git@github.com:ronanchris/interactive-node-network.git
- **Services Running**: 
  - Vite development server (port 5173)
  - Documentation dashboard server (port 3000)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. GitHub Pages Deployment
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for dashboard deployment
- Configured GitHub Pages to serve from gh-pages branch
- Successfully deployed dashboard to https://ronanchris.github.io/interactive-node-network/dashboard.html
- Implemented static version of dashboard for GitHub Pages compatibility

### 2. Dashboard Improvements
- Added collapsible sections for better organization
- Implemented status indicators with severity levels
- Created data directory structure for static deployment
- Modified dashboard to work without server-side features

### 3. Issues Identified
- Multiple development servers running simultaneously causing conflicts
- Frequent page reloads of dashboard.html observed
- Code base indexing not completing
- Server process management needs improvement

## Technical Details

### Server Issues
```bash
# Vite Development Server
> vite v6.2.2  ready in 348 ms
âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/interactive-node-network/

# Dashboard Server
Dashboard server running at http://localhost:3000/dashboard.html
```

### Page Reload Issues
- Observed frequent automatic reloads of docs/status/dashboard.html
- Multiple instances of page reloads occurring in quick succession
- Potential impact on IDE performance and indexing

## Current Status
- **Completed**:
  * GitHub Pages deployment
  * Dashboard static conversion
  * Status indicators implementation
  * Collapsible sections
- **In Progress**:
  * Resolving indexing issues
  * Server process management
- **Blocked**:
  * Code base indexing completion

## Technical Debt
- Need to consolidate development servers
- Improve process management
- Address frequent page reloads
- Review and optimize IDE indexing performance

## Next Steps
1. Clean up running processes
2. Implement better server management
3. Review and optimize IDE configuration
4. Monitor indexing performance
5. Consider implementing watch mode optimizations

## Resources Created/Modified
- `.github/workflows/dashboard.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `docs/status/dashboard.html` - Updated dashboard interface
- `docs/status/data/` - New data directory structure
- `package.json` - Added deployment scripts

## Transition Notes
- Dashboard now available on GitHub Pages
- Local development setup needs optimization
- Consider implementing process management improvements
- Monitor indexing performance after server consolidation

## Command History
```bash
# Server Management
npm run dev
npm run docs:dashboard
pkill -f "node.*interactive-node-network"

# Deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages dashboard deployment"
git push origin main
```

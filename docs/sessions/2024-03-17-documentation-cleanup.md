# Session: Documentation Cleanup and Reversion

## Session ID: 2024-03-17-documentation-cleanup

## Date: March 17, 2024

## Duration: ~1 hour

## Branch: main

## Key Accomplishments

1. Attempted Web Worker optimization for physics calculations
2. Reverted changes when optimization proved unstable
3. Successfully cleaned up documentation structure:
   - Removed redundant markdown files
   - Maintained essential documentation only
   - Preserved core functionality

## Technical Debt

- Web Worker implementation remains as a potential future optimization
- Some TypeScript files could be simplified/cleaned up
- Theme system could be streamlined

## Next Steps

1. Consider incremental improvements to TypeScript files
2. Evaluate theme system for potential simplification
3. Plan careful optimization strategy for physics calculations

## Resources Modified

- Removed numerous redundant .md files
- Maintained core documentation:
  - README.md
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
  - docs/CHANGELOG.md
  - docs/README.md
  - docs/architecture.md
  - docs/guides/development-guide.md

## Transition Notes

The application is currently in a stable state with working visualization and controls. Future optimizations should be approached incrementally with careful testing.

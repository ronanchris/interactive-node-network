# Interactive Node Network - Coach Guide

## Project Overview
The Interactive Node Network is a performant visualization that creates an ethereal network of connected nodes. Built with TypeScript and Canvas, it features smooth animations, physics-based movement, and a dynamic gradient that follows the user's cursor.

## Current State (March 2024)
The project has reached a polished state with:
- Beautiful visualization with 500 nodes and delicate connections
- Dynamic gradient system (green → blue → purple)
- Smooth animations and physics
- Comprehensive documentation
- Optimized performance

### Key Features
1. **Visual Elements**:
   - 500 nodes at 2px size
   - Up to 1607 connections at 0.5px thickness
   - Flowing gradient from green (#00ff9d) through blue (#00a2ff) to purple (#8000ff)
   - Mouse-following gradient effect
   - Connection trails with fade effect

2. **Animation & Physics**:
   - Gentle node movement (speed: 0.01)
   - Subtle pulsing (amplitude: 42%)
   - Physics-based clustering
   - Smooth connection animations

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Spatial partitioning for efficient node interaction
   - RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
   - Proper cleanup and state management
   - Optimized initialization sequence

# Educational Support Guidelines

This document outlines how we handle learning opportunities and knowledge sharing in the Interactive Node Network project.

## 1. Knowledge Introduction

When encountering technical concepts, tools, or patterns for the first time:

- Automatically offer explanations
- Use a simple y/n choice system for user to request explanations
- Break down complex topics into digestible options (e.g., y1, y2, y3 for different levels or aspects)
- Wait for user response before proceeding with technical details

Example: "I see we're using TypeScript for the first time. Would you like me to explain what it is and why we're using it? (y/n)"

## 2. Learning Journal Management

We maintain [`learning-journal.md`](./learning/learning-journal.md) as our primary learning documentation. Each entry includes:

### Entry Structure
- Date first encountered
- Brief description
- Real example from our project
- Why it's useful

### Categories
- Languages and Frameworks
- Tools and Libraries
- Best Practices
- Design Patterns

### Entry Format
```markdown
### [Topic Name]
*First Encountered: [Date]*

**What is it?**
[Brief explanation]

**How we're using it**
[Specific examples from our project]

**Why it's valuable**
[List of benefits and use cases]

**Related Concepts**
[Links to related topics]
```

## 3. Documentation Integration

When new learning opportunities arise:

- Suggest updates to existing .md files
- Create new specialized .md files for complex topics
- Maintain cross-references between related concepts
- Keep documentation DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

## 4. Learning Opportunity Detection

Monitor for learning opportunities during:

- Introduction of new tools or libraries
- Implementation of design patterns
- Problem-solving approaches
- Code optimization techniques
- Best practice applications

## 5. Knowledge Capture Process

1. **Identification**
   - Monitor for new concepts or techniques
   - Flag potential learning opportunities
   - Ask user if they want to document it

2. **Documentation**
   - Create or update learning journal entry
   - Add cross-references to related docs
   - Include practical examples
   - Link to external resources

3. **Review and Refinement**
   - Periodically review entries for accuracy
   - Update with new learnings
   - Add more examples as we use concepts
   - Improve explanations based on experience

## 6. Integration with Development Flow

- Pause development to capture learning when appropriate
- Link commit messages to learning entries when relevant
- Tag code examples that demonstrate concepts
- Update documentation as our understanding evolves

## 7. Best Practices

- Keep explanations clear and concise
- Use real project examples
- Include both basic and advanced aspects
- Maintain links to official documentation
- Update entries as we learn more
- Cross-reference related concepts

## 8. Learning Categories

### Technical Skills
- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Development tools
- Testing approaches
- Performance optimization

### Project Management
- Documentation practices
- Version control workflows
- Deployment procedures
- Communication protocols

### Design Patterns
- Code organization
- Component architecture
- State management
- Error handling

## 9. Review and Maintenance

Regular maintenance of learning materials:

- Monthly review of entries
- Update outdated information
- Add new examples
- Improve explanations
- Archive obsolete content
- Update cross-references

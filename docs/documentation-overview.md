# Interactive Node Network Documentation

## Overview
The Interactive Node Network is a beautiful and performant visualization that creates an ethereal network of connected nodes. The visualization features smooth animations, physics-based movement, and a dynamic gradient that follows the user's cursor.

## Key Features
- Real-time interactive node network visualization
- Smooth animations and physics-based movement
- Dynamic gradient following cursor movement
- Fully configurable through the control panel

## Default Configuration
The visualization starts with an ethereal configuration:
- **Nodes**: 500 nodes at 2px size
- **Connections**: Up to 1607 connections at 0.5px thickness
- **Colors**: Flowing gradient from green (#00ff9d) through blue (#00a2ff) to purple (#8000ff)
- **Animation**: 
  - Gentle node movement (speed: 0.01)
  - Subtle pulsing (amplitude: 42%)
  - Mouse-following gradient
  - Smooth connection trails

## Components
### InteractiveNodeNetwork
The main visualization component that handles:
- Canvas rendering and animation
- Node and connection management
- Physics calculations
- Mouse interaction
- Gradient overlay effects

### NetworkVisualizationController
The control panel component that provides:
- Node count and size adjustment
- Connection properties
- Animation speed controls
- Physics parameters
- Gradient customization

## Technical Details
### Performance Optimizations
- Spatial partitioning for efficient node interaction
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Proper cleanup and state management
- Optimized initialization sequence

### Visual Effects
- Multi-color gradient system
- Connection trail effects
- Node pulsing animation
- Mouse-following gradient overlay

## Usage Guide
### Basic Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the visualization

### Customization
The visualization can be customized through the control panel:
- Adjust node count and size
- Modify connection properties
- Change animation speeds
- Tune physics parameters
- Customize gradient colors and behavior

## Development
### Project Structure
```
src/
  components/
    InteractiveNodeNetwork.tsx    # Main visualization component
    NetworkVisualizationController.tsx  # Control panel component
  hooks/
    useAnimationFrame.ts          # Animation hook
    useMousePosition.ts           # Mouse tracking hook
  utils/
    physics.ts                    # Physics calculations
    gradient.ts                   # Gradient utilities
```

### Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices
- Implement proper cleanup
- Maintain performance optimizations
- Document code changes

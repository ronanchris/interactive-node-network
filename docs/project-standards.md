# Project Standards

This document outlines the standards and guidelines for the Interactive Node Network project. These standards ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the codebase.

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain strict type checking
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Use type inference where appropriate
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new features
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use Jest for unit testing
- Write integration tests for critical paths
- Mock external dependencies

## Documentation Standards

### Markdown
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Keep documentation up to date
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include table of contents for long documents

### Code Comments
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain non-obvious code
- Use JSDoc for function documentation
- Keep comments current with code changes
- Remove outdated comments

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Document error cases
- Keep OpenAPI/Swagger specs updated
- Include authentication requirements

## Git Workflow

### Branching
- Main branch: `main`
- Feature branches: `feature/*`
- Bug fixes: `fix/*`
- Documentation: `docs/*`
- Release branches: `release/*`

### Commits
- Use conventional commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Include issue references
- Write clear commit messages
- Squash commits before merging

### Pull Requests
- Require code review
- Pass all CI checks
- Update documentation
- Include test coverage
- Link related issues

## Development Process

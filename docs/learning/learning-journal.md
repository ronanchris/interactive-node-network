## Languages

### TypeScript
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
TypeScript is a programming language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. Think of it as JavaScript with extra rules about how data should be handled. It's like having a spell-checker for your code that catches errors before you run the program.

**How we're using it**
In our interactive node network project, we're using TypeScript to:
1. Define clear interfaces for our node network components
2. Ensure proper type checking for our visualization parameters
3. Make our code more maintainable and self-documenting

Example from our project:
```typescript
interface Node {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  radius: number;
  velocity: {
    x: number;
    y: number;
  };
  phase: number;
  brightness: number;
}
```

**Why it's valuable**
1. Catches errors early in development
2. Makes code easier to understand and maintain
3. Provides better tooling support (autocomplete, refactoring)
4. Helps document code behavior through type definitions

**Related Concepts**
- Interfaces
- Type Assertions
- Generics
- Type Inference

## Tools

### Vite
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
Vite is a modern build tool that serves as both a development server and a bundler for JavaScript applications. It's designed to be extremely fast by leveraging native ES modules during development.

**How we're using it**
In our project, Vite:
1. Provides our development server with hot module reloading
2. Handles TypeScript compilation
3. Manages our build process
4. Integrates with our React and Tailwind setup

Example from our project:
```typescript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/interactive-node-network/',
  plugins: [react()]
})
```

**Why it's valuable**
1. Extremely fast development server startup
2. Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
3. Built-in TypeScript support
4. Optimized production builds

### Tailwind CSS
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs directly in your HTML/JSX.

**How we're using it**
We're using Tailwind to:
1. Style our network visualization components
2. Create responsive layouts
3. Apply consistent design patterns

Example from our project:
```jsx
<div className="w-full max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4">
  <div className="mb-8 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg overflow-hidden">
    {/* Component content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Why it's valuable**
1. Rapid UI development
2. Consistent design system
3. No need to write custom CSS
4. Highly customizable

### Terser
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
Terser is a JavaScript minifier and compressor tool that optimizes JavaScript code for production. It's the modern successor to UglifyJS and is widely used in build tools like Vite.

**How we used it**
We initially used Terser through Vite's build configuration but encountered compatibility issues with GitHub Actions:
```typescript
build: {
  minify: 'terser',
  terserOptions: {
    compress: {
      drop_console: true,
      drop_debugger: true
    }
  }
}
```

**Why we switched**
Due to Unicode handling issues in GitHub Actions builds, we switched to esbuild for minification.

**Related Concepts**
- Code Minification
- Build Optimization
- Bundle Size Management
- Production Deployment

### esbuild
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
esbuild is an extremely fast JavaScript bundler and minifier written in Go. It's designed to be significantly faster than traditional JavaScript-based build tools while providing similar optimization capabilities.

**How we're using it**
We use esbuild through Vite's build configuration for production builds:
```typescript
build: {
  minify: 'esbuild',
  target: 'esnext',  // Modern browsers for better optimization
  cssCodeSplit: true,  // Enable CSS code splitting
  reportCompressedSize: false,  // Skip reporting compressed size
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        react: ['react', 'react-dom'],
        vendor: ['react-colorful']
      }
    }
  }
},
optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['react', 'react-dom', 'react-colorful'],
  esbuildOptions: {
    target: 'esnext',
    drop: ['console', 'debugger']  // Remove debug code
  }
},
esbuild: {
  drop: ['console', 'debugger'],  // Clean production code
  target: 'esnext'
}
```

Our configuration:
1. Uses modern JavaScript features (esnext)
2. Removes console.log and debugger statements
3. Splits CSS for better caching
4. Chunks React and vendor code separately
5. Skips compressed size reporting for faster builds

**Why it's valuable**
1. Extremely fast build times
2. Good compatibility with CI/CD environments
3. Built-in minification and bundling
4. Native support in Vite
5. More reliable Unicode handling
6. Optimized production code size
7. Better browser caching through code splitting

**Related Concepts**
- Build Performance
- Code Bundling
- Development vs Production Builds
- CI/CD Compatibility
- Code Splitting
- Tree Shaking
- Modern JavaScript Features

## Frameworks

### React
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need dynamic data handling and complex UI interactions.

**How we're using it**
In our network visualization project, we use React to:
1. Create reusable visualization components
2. Manage state for our interactive features
3. Handle user interactions and updates
4. Organize our code into maintainable components

Example from our project:
```typescript
const InteractiveNodeNetwork: React.FC<InteractiveNodeNetworkProps> = ({ 
  nodeCount = 30, 
  themeVariant = 'default',
  mouseInteractionRadius = 200,
  height = '100%',
  customTheme = null
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

**Why it's valuable**
1. Component-based architecture
2. Efficient rendering with Virtual DOM
3. Rich ecosystem of tools and libraries
4. Strong TypeScript support

## Best Practices

### Component Organization
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
A structured approach to organizing React components and their related files to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.

**How we're using it**
We organize our components by:
1. Keeping related files together
2. Using clear naming conventions
3. Separating concerns (presentation vs. logic)
4. Maintaining a clear component hierarchy

Example from our project:
```
src/
  components/
    NodeNetworkWrapper.tsx
    InteractiveNodeNetwork.tsx
  types/
    network.ts
  utils/
    calculations.ts
```

**Why it's valuable**
1. Easier navigation of codebase
2. Better code reusability
3. Simplified maintenance
4. Clearer project structure

### GitHub SSH Authentication
*First Encountered: March 17, 2024*

**What is it?**
SSH (Secure Shell) authentication is a secure way to interact with GitHub without using passwords or tokens. It uses a pair of cryptographic keys: a private key (kept secret on your computer) and a public key (shared with GitHub).

**How we're using it**
We set up SSH authentication for seamless GitHub access:
1. Generated SSH key pair:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "computer-name-github"
   ```
2. Added public key to GitHub (Settings â†’ SSH Keys)
3. Configured repository to use SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
   ```

Example workflow for multiple computers:
```bash
# On Computer 1 (M3-Max)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "M3-Max-GitHub"
# Add to GitHub as "M3-Max"

# On Computer 2 (MacBook)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "MacBook-GitHub"
# Add to GitHub as "MacBook"

# Verify SSH connection on either computer
ssh -T git@github.com

# Check current remote URL
git remote -v

# Switch from HTTPS to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
```

Each computer maintains its own secure connection, and you can:
- Push/pull without tokens
- Easily identify which computer accessed GitHub
- Revoke access for a specific computer if needed

**Why it's valuable**
1. More secure than password authentication
2. No need to manage or enter tokens
3. Each computer can have its own key
4. Keys don't expire like tokens do
5. Easy to revoke access for specific computers

**Related Concepts**
- Public Key Cryptography
- Git Remote URLs
- GitHub Authentication Methods
- Multi-Machine Development

**Best Practices**
1. Use unique keys for each computer
2. Give keys descriptive names
3. Keep private keys secure
4. Back up important keys
5. Remove keys from GitHub when no longer needed

### Documentation Health
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
A measure of documentation quality, coverage, and maintainability. See [Documentation Health](../glossary.md#documentation-health) for more details.

### Documentation Coverage
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
The extent to which code and features are documented. See [Documentation Coverage](../glossary.md#documentation-coverage) for more details.

### Health Checks
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
Automated checks for documentation quality and coverage. See [Health Checks](../glossary.md#health-checks) for more details.

### CI/CD Integration
*First Encountered: March 16, 2024*

**What is it?**
Integration of documentation checks into our CI/CD pipeline. See [CI/CD Integration](../automation-rules.md) for more details.

### Coverage Analysis Scripts
*First Encountered: 2024-03-17*

**What is it?**
A coverage analysis script is an automated tool that systematically evaluates the completeness and quality of project documentation. It performs several key checks:
1. Documentation presence (README files in directories)
2. Link validity (finding broken references)
3. Documentation freshness (identifying outdated files)
4. Coverage metrics (calculating documentation completeness)

**How we're using it**
In our project, we've implemented a comprehensive coverage analysis system in `scripts/docs/coverage.ts`:
```typescript
interface CoverageReport {
  total_files: number;
  documented_files: number;
  coverage_percentage: number;
  missing_documentation: string[];
  broken_links: string[];
  outdated_files: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
}

// Example usage
const coverage = new DocumentationCoverage(rootDir);
const report = await coverage.analyzeCoverage();
```

The script is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions, which:
- Runs on every PR affecting documentation
- Enforces minimum 80% documentation coverage
- Provides automated recommendations
- Comments on PRs with coverage reports

**Why it's valuable**
1. Automated Quality Assurance
   - Consistently measures documentation completeness
   - Identifies gaps and broken references
   - Maintains documentation freshness

2. Development Workflow
   - Integrates with CI/CD pipeline
   - Provides immediate feedback
   - Enforces documentation standards

3. Maintenance Benefits
   - Reduces manual review time
   - Prevents documentation drift
   - Ensures consistent quality

### Markdown Link Patterns
*First Encountered: [Current Date]*

**What is it?**
A consistent pattern for handling Markdown links in our documentation that addresses several challenges:
1. Relative vs. absolute paths
2. Links to sections within documents
3. Links across different documentation hierarchies
4. Links to external resources

**Issues Encountered**
1. Different tools interpret Markdown links differently:
   - Some tools require `.md` extension
   - Others automatically resolve without the extension
   - Some tools handle spaces differently
2. Section links (anchors) can be problematic:
   - Spaces in headers get converted to hyphens
   - Case sensitivity varies by tool
   - Special characters handling is inconsistent
3. Path resolution varies:
   - Some tools resolve from the current file location
   - Others resolve from the project root
   - Windows vs. Unix path separators can cause issues

**Our Standard Solution**
1. Internal Document Links:
   ```markdown
   - Same directory: [Link Text](./file-name.md)
   - Parent directory: [Link Text](../file-name.md)
   - Child directory: [Link Text](./subdirectory/file-name.md)
   - Section within same file: [Link Text](#section-name)
   - Section in another file: [Link Text](./file-name.md#section-name)
   ```

2. Link Formatting Rules:
   - Always include the `.md` extension for documentation files
   - Use hyphens instead of spaces in filenames
   - Use lowercase for filenames and paths
   - Use relative paths from the current file's location
   - Start relative paths with `./` or `../` for clarity

3. Section Anchors:
   - Use lowercase for section references
   - Replace spaces with hyphens
   - Remove special characters
   - Example: `## My Section (2023)` â†’ `#my-section-2023`

**Why it's valuable**
1. Consistent linking improves documentation maintainability
2. Reduces broken links in documentation
3. Makes automated link checking more reliable
4. Simplifies documentation migration if needed
5. Improves compatibility across different Markdown tools

**Implementation**
We've implemented these rules in:
1. Documentation structure
2. Link checking tools
3. Documentation automation
4. CI/CD validation

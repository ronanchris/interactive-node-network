## Overview
This document analyzes our AI interaction patterns, distinguishing between commonly established patterns and our novel implementations. This analysis helps understand where our approach brings innovation to AI assistance in development environments.

## Common/Established Patterns

These patterns are widely implemented in various AI systems:

1. **Basic Educational Support**
   - Standard explanations of technical concepts
   - Simple Q&A interactions
   - Basic documentation references

2. **Simple Memory Management**
   - Basic context tracking
   - Standard session limitations
   - Simple state preservation

3. **Basic Documentation Updates**
   - Manual triggers for updates
   - Simple file modifications
   - Basic version control integration

4. **Standard Error Handling**
   - Error message explanations
   - Basic troubleshooting steps
   - Common solution suggestions

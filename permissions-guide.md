## Mac and Linux Permission Solutions

### npm Global Installation Issues

**When you see errors like:** "EACCES: permission denied" or "npm ERR! code EACCES"

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
I'm getting EACCES permission errors when trying to install packages. Can you help me fix npm permissions?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**

1. **Temporary Solution (Using sudo):**
   ```
   sudo npm install -g [package-name]
   ```
   Note: This is quick but not ideal for security reasons.

2. **Recommended Permanent Fix:**
   ```
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/lib/node_modules
   ```

3. **Using Node Version Manager (nvm):**
   ```
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.x/install.sh | bash
   ```
   Then restart your terminal and install Node.js through nvm:
   ```
   nvm install node
   ```

### File Writing Permission Issues

**When you see errors like:** "EACCES: permission denied, open 'file'"

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
I don't have permission to write to files in this directory. How can I fix this?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**
```
sudo chown -R $(whoami) /path/to/your/project
```

## Windows Permission Solutions

### npm Global Installation Issues

**When you see errors like:** "Error: EPERM: operation not permitted"

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
I'm getting permission errors on Windows when installing packages. What should I do?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**

1. **Run Command Prompt as Administrator:**
   - Ask Cursor: "How do I run Command Prompt as Administrator?"
   - It will explain the right-click methods or Windows search methods

2. **Use Local Installation Instead:**
   ```
   npm install [package-name] --save-dev
   ```

3. **Change npm's Default Directory:**
   ```
   mkdir C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm-global
   npm config set prefix 'C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm-global'
   ```
   Then add this to your PATH environment variable.

### Antivirus or Security Software Issues

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
My antivirus seems to be blocking npm or node operations. How can I resolve this?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**
- Adding exceptions to your antivirus software
- Temporarily disabling real-time scanning during installation
- Creating exclusions for your development directories

## Universal Solutions for Any Platform

### Using Local Dependencies Instead of Global

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
How can I avoid permission issues by using local dependencies instead of global ones?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**
- Using `npm install` without the `-g` flag
- Setting up package.json scripts to use local binaries
- Using npx to run binaries without installing them globally

### Using Docker Containers

**Prompt to Cursor:**
```
Can we use Docker to avoid permission issues with node and npm?
```

**Expected Solutions from Cursor:**
- Setting up a basic Docker environment for the project
- Creating a Dockerfile with the necessary permissions
- Using Docker Compose for easier management

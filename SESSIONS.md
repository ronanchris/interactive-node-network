The [Coach's Guide](./docs/guides/coach-michael-stolarz-guide.md) contains detailed information about AI interaction patterns and automation rules.

## Cross-Machine Development Guidelines

### Using Multiple Machines
When switching between different computers:

1. **Dropbox-Based Workflow**
   - Project is stored in Dropbox at: `/Team Ronan Dropbox/chris ronan/cursor projects/interactive-node-network`
   - No need to clone - Dropbox handles synchronization
   - Ensure Dropbox sync is complete before starting work
   - Avoid running project simultaneously on multiple machines

2. **Starting a New Session**
   - Open the project directory in Cursor
   - Ask AI to initialize by reviewing rules and documentation
   - AI will follow the initialization process:
     * Load `RULES.md` and `README.md` for core context
     * Check recent `SESSIONS.md` entries
     * Scan relevant documentation
     * Verify machine configuration

3. **Best Practices**
   - Stop development server before switching machines
   - Commit changes before ending a session
   - Document any machine-specific configurations
   - Note any ongoing tasks in session summaries

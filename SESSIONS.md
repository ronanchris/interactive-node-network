Would you like me to generate a session summary for our current work? Here's how we would do it:

1. I'll note the key changes we've made
2. Document any decisions or new practices
3. List what's still pending
4. Suggest next steps

Just let me know if you'd like to start a fresh chat with a clean context after the summary.

# Project Sessions

## Session 2024-03-17

### Documentation Update and Repository Management

#### Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive documentation structure:
   - Added tutorials (basic usage, advanced features, integration, customization)
   - Created best practices documentation (development, security, performance, maintenance)
   - Added system architecture documentation
   - Set up AI helper system with initialization rules

2. Repository Management:
   - Successfully committed and pushed all documentation changes
   - Verified GitHub Pages deployment (live at ronanchris.github.io/interactive-node-network)
   - Confirmed correct gh-pages branch configuration
   - Discussed potential repository renaming (deferred for later consideration)

#### Key Decisions
- Decided to keep broken documentation links as a lower priority task
- Confirmed that gh-pages branch configuration is correct post un-forking
- Deferred repository renaming discussion for future consideration

#### Next Steps
- Address documentation broken links when needed
- Consider repository renaming requirements and implications
- Continue with core functionality implementation

# Development Sessions

## Session 1: Initial Setup and Basic Visualization
- Set up TypeScript React project
- Created basic node network visualization
- Implemented canvas rendering
- Added basic mouse interaction

## Session 2: Enhanced Controls and Themes
- Added control panel with sliders
- Implemented dark theme
- Added node size and count controls
- Improved performance with requestAnimationFrame

## Session 3: Physics and Animation
- Added physics-based node movement
- Implemented connection logic
- Enhanced performance with spatial partitioning
- Added animation controls

## Session 4: Gradient and Visual Effects
- Added gradient overlay system
- Implemented mouse-following gradient
- Enhanced connection trails
- Improved visual aesthetics

## Session 5: Performance Optimization
- Fixed initialization issues
- Improved animation loop efficiency
- Enhanced state management
- Added cleanup processes

## Session 6: Documentation and Polish
- Added beautiful preview image to README
- Set optimal default configuration:
  - 500 nodes with delicate connections
  - Green-blue-purple gradient
  - Smooth animation settings
- Enhanced project documentation
- Fixed remaining initialization issues

### Current Configuration
The visualization now features:
- 500 nodes at 2px size
- Up to 1607 connections at 0.5px thickness
- Flowing gradient from green (#00ff9d) through blue (#00a2ff) to purple (#8000ff)
- Gentle node movement (speed: 0.01)
- Subtle pulsing (amplitude: 42%)
- Mouse-following gradient
- Smooth connection trails

### Next Steps
Potential improvements for future sessions:
- Add more interactive features
- Implement zoom functionality
- Add node selection and highlighting
- Create preset configurations
- Add animation sequences

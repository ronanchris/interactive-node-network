### Documentation Update and Repository Management

#### Completed Tasks
1. Created comprehensive documentation structure:
   - Added tutorials (basic usage, advanced features, integration, customization)
   - Created best practices documentation (development, security, performance, maintenance)
   - Added system architecture documentation
   - Set up AI helper system with initialization rules

2. Repository Management:
   - Successfully committed and pushed all documentation changes
   - Verified GitHub Pages deployment (live at ronanchris.github.io/interactive-node-network)
   - Confirmed correct gh-pages branch configuration
   - Discussed potential repository renaming (deferred for later consideration)

#### Key Decisions
- Decided to keep broken documentation links as a lower priority task
- Confirmed that gh-pages branch configuration is correct post un-forking
- Deferred repository renaming discussion for future consideration

#### Next Steps
- Address documentation broken links when needed
- Consider repository renaming requirements and implications
- Continue with core functionality implementation
